## Twister App

[App Board](https://trello.com/b/5tHim3Ek/flash-card-app) - Deprecated

Ended up working on a MVC version for the Flash Card App

## Todo

1. Update Readme
  a. Add description, purpose and how to run locally the app
  b. What did I learn ? React's userReducer function and context feature using TS
  c. 3rd Party library research for the slider - Full page js, react-slick and slick-carousel, talk about hurdles, pros and cons
2. Add testing - specific to react
3. Deploy on netlify
4. Make app responsive
5. Add accessiblity 
6. Switch to mui style hook
